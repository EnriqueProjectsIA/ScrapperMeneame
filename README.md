## 1. Why meneame is interesting?

Meneame is one of the most popular news aggregators within Spain and it has social netwok features. Due to its structure, its present several characteristics which make it quite interesting for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Among other possibilities:
  * Meneame allows a distinction between queue news and news that reach front page. That gives a natural splitting between TOP and NO-TOP news.
  * News typically have a significant number of comments, which allows sentiment analysis linked to a particular topic.
  *	News and comments, in first approximation, are not recommended to a list of friends and contacts (everyone has access to everything). That has interesting implications for network analysis.
